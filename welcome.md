Welcome to my website! My name is Jeffry Mallow. I am a physicist, Yiddishist, Zionist, feminist, and humorist. I have a Ph.D. in Physics and a Bachelor of Jewish Literature.  I have lectured and published widely in both, about fifty-fifty.  I am the author or co-author of seven books, with an eighth on the way.  I am a member of several organizations, among them the American Association of Physics Teachers and the YIVO Institute of Jewish Research. I grew up in the Bronx, moved to Chicago for my Ph.D. I lived in Israel and Denmark, with frequent visits to France with my wife, Ann, who is binational Franco-American. (No relation to the spaghetti.)

I think my most important contribution to society was the recognition and naming of the phenomenon of “science anxiety”. I was co-founder with psychologists of the first science anxiety clinic, at my academic home, Loyola University Chicago.  Several books and research papers and good trips to Scandinavia have followed.
