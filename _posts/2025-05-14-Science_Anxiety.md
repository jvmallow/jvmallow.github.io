Science anxiety and how to conquer it

In 1978, as a young assistant professor at Loyola University Chicago, I became aware that some students were doing poorly on exams or class activities in general, although it seemed to me that they were bright and hardworking. What was going on? The term “science anxiety” leapt into mind, and I coined it forthwith. I hearkened back to my own days as an undergraduate physics major. I experienced crippling panic on exams, and did so poorly that my advisor told me that I was not smart enough to become a physicist. In the early 70’s, the concept of math anxiety had been recognized and various measures were being taken to alleviate it, including “clinics”: small groups of math- anxious students working with mathematicians and psychologists. I proposed to the Loyola Counseling Center that we try a Science Anxiety Clinic. 

One glaring feature of math anxiety was gender disparity: women were more math anxious, and avoided studying math. Was this true about science? The answer turned out to be Yes.
