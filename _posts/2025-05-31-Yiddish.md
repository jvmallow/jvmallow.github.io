# What is Yiddish?

Yiddish is the language of East European Jewry. It is over 1,000 years old. The oldest Yiddish document uncovered is a bill of lading dated about 1200 CE.This suggests that the spoken language is a century or two older. The great Jewish scholar Rashi, who lived from 1040 to 1105 CE, and whose native tongue was Old French, referred to Yiddish as "leshoneynu": a Hebrew word meaning "our language". 
Currently it finds a resurgence in places as distant as America and Australia. Thousands are studying it in classes around the world and on Duolingo. 

While Yiddish is not my native language, my immigrant grandparents convinced my American parents to send me to afternoon Yiddish school, in lieu of Hebrew school. I started at nine years old, fell in love with the language and culture, and twelve years later earned a Bachelor of Jewish Literature degree. The love affair is stronger than ever. 

# The structure of Yiddish

Yiddish is written in the Hebrew alphabet. But the letter designations are not the same as in Hebrew. To put it simply, Hebrew  "has no vowels"; that is, vowel sounds are either written as diacritical marks above, below,or next to letters, or not written at all, for readers who can deduce the vowel sounds from clues in the consonants.  Yiddish on the other hand, like all Indo-European languages, has letters ascribed to vowels just as to consonants. The four letters aleph א, vov ו, yud י, ayin ע, and their combinations provide the vowel sounds: aleph- ah or uh; vov- oo; yud- ee; ayin- eh; vov yud- oy; two yuds- ey (like hey) or ay (like bayou). It's slightly more complicated, but this will do for the moment. 

A word about transliteration.You can find it at https://www.yiddishwit.com/YIVO%20transliteration%20chart.pdf.  Without going into details about the rules, here are some examples: "bukh": "book", "kishke": "stuffed derma". "kh" is pronounced as in "Bach". The final sound "eh" as in English is not written "eh", but just "e". But here's a counterexample: the Shabbes bread should be written "khale". But that's taken as pretentious, given its ubiquitous spelling, "challah". So that's how we "faynshmeckers" ("fancy sniffers"; somewhat less pejoratively, "cognocenti") leave it.  Ditto "bagel" (technically "beygl"). Can we same about the holiday "khanike"? We might be able to default to the English spelling, but what is that, "Chanukah, or Hanukkah"? So I like to stick with "khanike". Note, by the way, that Yiddish, like Hebrew, has no capital letters.

Yiddish is phonetic--more or less. There is a so-called Standard Yiddish, for which every written vowel is correlated with a single sound. But nobody speaks it, except those of us who went to Yiddish school! This standard dialect was created by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research https://www.yivo.org/, one of whose purposes was to make the language phonetic. To do this, they took the phonetic vowels from each of the dialects; thus, Standard Yiddish is an amalgam of them, getting rid of the ones that didn't fit. Here is an example. In Standard Yiddish and most of the dialects, "Where do you live?" is "Vu voynt ir?". So far, so good. But in Litvish Yiddish, spoken in and around Lithuania, they don't distinguish between the sounds "oy" and "ey": "Moyshe" becomes "Meyshe", and so forth. So "voynt" becomes "veynt". For the Litvaks, "Vu voynt ir?" becomes, "Vu veynt ir?". But that presents a problem: "veynt" also means "cry". Uh oh: "Where do you cry?" might be heard by the Angel of Death (if you believe in such things), who would say, "You're crying? I'll give you something to cry about." So the Litvaks trick the A of D by saying, "Vu freyt ir zikh?", "Where are you rejoicing?" 

Not to be unfair to the Litvaks, here's an example from Polish Yiddish. They don't distinguish between "oo" and "ee". Thus, the person who leads the bride into the synagogue is pronounced in Standard Yiddish, "oonterfeerer". The Polish dialect says "interfeerer"", a whole different role.

# The linguistic history of Yiddish

Yiddish is about 50% cognate with modern German (although its origins are with much older forms). For comparison, Spanish and Portuguese are closer to each other, and Norwegian was virtually indistinguishable from Danish well into the 20th century. I mention this to banish the calumny that Yiddish is a "jargon", a "dialect of (modern) German" or a "bastardized" form of it. Some modern German words are the same as in Yiddish. Thus, "weekly" in Yiddish is "vokhntlekh"; compare German "wöchentlich". But Yiddish also has "vokhedik", which means "during the week" or "profane", distinguishing it from "shabbesdik": "holy". Both Yiddish and German have a word for "ask"; respectively Yiddish "fregn", German "fragen". But Yiddish also has "opfregn": to refute, not always nicely.

About 20% of East European Yiddish is rooted in a Slavic language called Old Church Slavonic, which entered the language when many Jews came to Poland in the 13th and 14th centuries, due to lifted legal/religious restrictions.  It gives us many of the "homey words, like "tate" (dad), "mame" (mom). Compare the more formal Germanic-root words "foter" (father), "muter" (mother).   Sometimes German root words are combined with Slavic endings; some nice--"zuninke": "dear little son", "gotenyu": "dearest God"; some not so nice-- "nudnik" (no translation needed), "yungatsh": "brat", and--wait for it--"shnayderuk": a tailor who can't sew. 

10 to 15% of Yiddish is "mediated" Hebrew and Aramaic:, that is, older forms of those languages, distinct from the modern Israeli version. The same word can mean different things, and with different pronunciations. For example, "efsher" means "maybe" in mediated Hebrew; "efshar" means "possible" in modern Hebrew. The emphases are on different syllables: EFsher, efSHAR. For some words, the plurals are different. Sabbath in Hebrew is "shaBAT", female plural "shabaTOT"; in Yiddish, "SHAbbes", masculine plural "shaBEYSim" (Hebrew plural!).  Some words mix the Germanic with the mediated Hebrew. Doctor: singular DOkter (Germanic), plural (Hebrew) dokTOYrim. Sometimes, two very different words, both Hebrew, mean the same thing. Holiday in modern Hebrew is "khag". In the mediated Hebrew of Yiddish it's "yontef", a shortening of "yom tov": "good day"  (technically "day good").

The remainder of Yiddish comprises holdovers from languages acquired by Jews as they migrated from land to land.  "Shul": "school" stems from the Greek "skole", meaning "free time" (hardly a description of Yiddish schools). "Apikoyres": "heretic" derives from the Greek "Epicurean". "Tsholnt", the stew usually prepared on Friday without need for reheating - cooking on the Sabbath is prohbited by Orthodoxy-has its origin in the Old French "chalant": "heating". (My wife Ann, a scholar of Old French, discovered this.)

For a comparison, English, like Yiddish, traces its roots to several languages, mostly Anglo-Saxon and Norman French. The former, spoken by the earlier inhabitants, gives us the homey words like "house (no pun intended); the latter, spoken by the Norman conquerors of 1066, tends to give us the fancier words, like "residence".

One more thing: the mediated Hebrew and Aramaic words are left with their traditional spelling, which is not phonetic in Yiddish--unless you're a Soviet Communist. Intent on removing any remnant of religion, they chose to "phoneticize" the Hebrew/Aramiaic words.
