Yiddish is the language of East European Jewry. It is over 1,000 years old. It represents the history of East European Jewry, and finds a resurgence in places as distant as America and Australia. Thousands are studying it in classes around the world and on Duolingo. While it is not my native language, my immigrant grandparents convinced my American parents to send me to afternoon Yiddish school, in lieu of Hebrew school. I started at nine years old, fell in love with the language and culture, and twelve years later earned a Bachelor of Jewish Literature degree. The love affair is stronger than ever. 

WELCOME TO YIDDISH!

# The structure of Yiddish
The vocabulary, grammar, and structure of Yiddish comprise several components. It is about 50% cognate with modern German (although its origins are in much older forms). For comparison, Spanish and Portuguese are closer, and Norwegian was virtually indistinguishable from Danish well into the 20th century. I mention this to banish the calumny that Yiddish is a "jargon", a dialect of German or a "bastardized" form of it. 

About 20% of East European Yddish is rooted in a Slavic language called Old Church Slavonic.

10 to 15% is "mediated" Hebrew and Aramaic:, that is, older forms of those languages, distinct from the modern Israeli version. The same word may mean different things, and with slightly different pronunciations, in each. For example, "efsher" means "maybe" in mediated Hebrew; "efshar" means "possible" in modern Hebrew. The emphases are on different syllables: EFsher, efSHAR. Sometims the plurals are different. Sabbath in Hebrew is "shaBAT", female plural "shabaTOT". In Yiddish, "SHAbbes", masculine plural "shaBEYSim". Some words mix the Germanic with the mediated Hebrew. Doctor: singular DOCter (Germanic), plural (Hebrew) docTOYrim. 

The remainder are holdovers from languages acquired by Jews as they migrated from land to land.  "Shul": "school" stems from the Greek "skole", meaning "free time" (hardly a description of Yiddish schools). "Apikoyres": "heretic" derives from the Greek "Epicurean". "Tsholnt", the stew usually prepared on Friday without need for reheating--cooking on the Sabbath is prohbited by Orthodoxy--has its origin in Old French "chalant": "heating". (My wife Ann, a scholar of Old French, discovered this.)

English, like Yiddish, traces its roots to several languages: mostly Anglo-Saxon and Norman French. The former, spoken by the earlier inhabitants, the  Angles, gives us the homey words like "house (no pun intended); the latter, spoken by the Norman conquerors (1066), tends to give us the fancier words, like "residence".

Yiddish is written in the Hebrew alphabet. But the letter designations are not the same as in Hebrew. To put it simply, Hebrew  "has no vowels"; that is, vowel sounds are either written as diacritical marks above, below,or next to letters, or not written at all, for readers who can deduce the vowel sounds from clues in the consonants.  Yiddish on the other hand, like all Indo-European languages, has letters ascribed to vowels just as to consonants. The four letters aleph א, vov ו, yud י, ayin ע, and their combinations provide the vowel sounds: aleph- ah or uh; vov- oo; yud- ee; ayin- eh; vov yud- oy; two yuds- ey (like hey) or ay (like bayou).

Yiddish is phonetic--more or less. There is a so-called Standard Yiddish, for which every written vowel has a single sound. But nobody speaks it, except those of us who went to Yiddish school! This standard dialect was created by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research https://www.yivo.org/, with one purpose (among others) was to make the language phonetic. To do this, they took the phonetic vowels from each of the dialects; thus, Standard Yiddish is an amalgam of them.  Here is an example. In Litvish Yiddish, spoken in Lithuania the Litvaks donn't ddtinguhish betwen the sound "oy" and "ey". Thus, in Standard Yiddih and other dialects, "Where do you live" is "Vu voynt ir?".  In Litvish Yidish, it's "Vu veynt ir". But that presents a problem "Veynt" also means "cry". But "Where do you cry?" would be heard by the Angel of Death (if you believe in such things), who would say "You're crying--I'll give you something to cry about." So the Litvaks the A of G by saying, "Vu freyt ir zikh?", "Where are you rejoicing?"  A word about spelling (in Standard Yiddish). "Kh" is the gutteral sound, pronounced as in "Bach". But it is not written "ch": that's for the sound like  "charm". Except sometimes it is. The Shabbes bread shoud be written "khale", but that's pretentious, given its ubiquitous spelling , "challeh". So that's how we "faynshmeckers" ("fancy sniffers"; less pejoratively, "cognocenti") spell it.

# The history of Yiddish
Yiddish is over 1,000 years old. It represents the history of East European Jewry, and finds a resurgence in places as distant as America and Australia. The oldest Yiddish document uncovered is a bill of lading dated about 1200 CE.This suggests that the spoken language is a century or two older. The great Jewish scholar Rashi, who lived from 1040 to 1105 CE, and whose native tongue was Old French, referred to Yiddish as "leshoneynu": a Hebrew word meaning "our language".
