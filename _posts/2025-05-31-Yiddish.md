# The structure of Yiddish
Yiddish is over 1,000 years old. It represents the history of East European Jewry, and finds a resurgence in places as distant as America and Australia. The oldest Yiddish document uncovered is a bill of lading dated about 1200 CE.This suggests that the spoken language is a century or two older. 

The vocabulary, grammar, and structure of Yiddish reveal the history of what became East-European Jewry. It is about 50% cognate with modern German. For comparison, Spanish and Portuguese are closer, and Norwegian  was virtually indistinguishable from Danish well into the 20th century. I mention this to banish the calumny that Yiddish is a jargon, a dialect of German, or a "bastardized" form of it. 

About 20% of East European Yddish is rooted in a Slavic language Called Old Church Slavonic. (There is a Yiddish dialect, spoken by Jews who did not move east, that does not have this component.)  

10 to 15% is "mediated" Hebrew and Aramaic:, that is, older forms of those languages, distinct from the modern Israeli version. The same word may mean different things in each. For example, "efshar" means "maybe" in mediated Hebrew, "possible" in modern Hebrew.

The remainder are holdovers from languages spoken by Jews as they moved north after migrations in the first millennium CE.  "Shul": "school" stems from the Greek "skole" meaning "free time" (hardly a description of Yiddish schools). "Apikoyres": "heretic" derives from the Greek "Epicurean". "Tsholnt", the stew usually prepared on Friday without need for reheating--cooking on the Sabbath is prohbited by Orthodoxy--has its origin in Old French "chalant": "heating". (My wife Ann, a scholar of Old French, discovered this.)

English, like Yiddish, traces its roots to several languages: mostly Anglo-Saxon and Norman French. The former, for example, gives us "house; the latter, "residence".
