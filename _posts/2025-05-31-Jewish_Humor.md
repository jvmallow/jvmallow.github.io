Many years ago, in what was an otherwise relatively humorless existence as a doctoral student in physics, I began collecting Jewish jokes. It started simply. I heard a joke, retold it, and exchanged jokes with friends. I then began collecting books of Jewish humor—first in Yiddish and then in other languages as well. As my collection grew, a kind of growth principle took over, like a runaway nuclear chain reaction. For every joke I told, I acquired at least two new ones in exchange. In short order, the thing was completely out of hand. I took to carrying blank scraps of paper to Jewish events in case I heard new jokes. In extreme cases, I wrote them down on the napkins. (Jewish events always include food, and physicists are adept at napkin-writing.) I began doing stand-up comedy. Sometimes, it was in the guise of a lecture on Jewish humor; other times, it was club dates with Chicago’s Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. 

Many books are written about the meaning and purpose(s) of humor. Some have focused on Jewish humor. I have written one: 
Our Pal God and Other Presumptions

Here are some of the jokes therein and newer ones thereout. I'll upload one or more each week. Watch this space!


THE OLDEST JEWISH JOKE–PROBABLY

It would be impossible to say what the oldest Jewish joke is. But the oldest Jewish joke theme is probably the Ten Commandments. After smashing the first set of tablets, Moses returns with the second set.

“I have good news and bad news,” he announces to the assembled Israelites. “The good news is, I got Him down to only ten. The bad news is, adultery stays in.”

THE NEWEST JEWISH JOKE-PROBABLY

A priest, a minister, and a rabbit walk into  bar.  The bartender asks the rabbit, "What are you doing here?" The rabbit answers, "I came in on Autocorrect.""
