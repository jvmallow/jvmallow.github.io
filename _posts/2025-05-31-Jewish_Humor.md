Many years ago, in what was an otherwise relatively humorless existence as a doctoral student in physics, I began collecting Jewish jokes. It started simply. I heard a joke, retold it, and exchanged jokes with friends. I then began collecting books of Jewish humor—first in Yiddish and then in other languages as well. As my collection grew, a kind of growth principle took over, like a runaway nuclear chain reaction. For every joke I told, I acquired at least two new ones in exchange. In short order, the thing was completely out of hand. I took to carrying blank scraps of paper to Jewish events in case I heard new jokes. In extreme cases, I wrote them down on the napkins. (Jewish events always include food, and physicists are adept at napkin-writing.)
I began doing stand-up comedy. Sometimes, it was in the guise of a lecture on Jewish humor; other times, it was club dates with Chicago’s Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. 

Many books are written about the meaning and purpose(s) of humor. Some have focused on Jewish humor. I have written one: Our Pal God and Other Presumptions
https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/108093-OUR-PAL-GOD-and-Other-Presumptions.
Here are some of the jokes therin and therout.

SPORTY SYNAGOGUE

A Jewish golfer is a real duffer: never done better than ten over par. One day he’s playing, and he sees a foursome of ultra-Orthodox Jews playing amazingly good golf. He watches for a while, and finally goes over and asks them the secret of their skill.
“Religion,” they reply, “Are you Jewish?” He says yes.
“OK. Here’s what you have to do: pray three times a day. Keep kosher. And join the Orthodox shul (synagogue).”
Our hero gets down his old talles (prayer shawl) and tefillin (phylacteries), and prays regularly. He gets two new sets of dishes, one for milk and one for meat, and makes his home strictly kosher. And he joins the Orthodox shul down the street. But his game does not improve.
Two months later, he encounters the same pious foursome, playing their usual under-par game.
“I don’t know what I’m doing wrong,” he complains, “I did everything you said.”
“You pray regularly?” they ask.
“Three times a day.”
“Keep kosher?”
“Strictly.”
“Did you join an Orthodox shul?”
“Yes, I joined Anshe Sholem, just down the street.”
“Ah,”say the foursome, “That’s the problem. Anshe Sholem’s the tennis shul.”

THIS YOU CALL ENGLISH? A TRIAD.

An elderly Jewish man is run over. He’s lying in the street when the paramedics arrive. As they load him carefully onto the stretcher, one asks, “Are you comfortable?”
He replies, “Thank God, I make a living.”

An elderly Jewish lady is run over. A lawyer rushes to her side, hands her his card, and says, “Call me: I can get you damages.”
The lady replies, “Damages I already have. What I need is repairs!”

“Sadie,” asks Minnie, “tell me, do you and Sam have mutual orgasm.”
Sadie thinks for a minute and says, “No, I think we have State Farm.”

TO FORGIVE IS DIVINE

It is required that Jews who have been quarreling with each other make peace before Yom Kippur.  Asking and receiving forgiveness from one’s fellow must precede asking forgiveness from God.  

 Two Jews who have been at each others’ throats for the entire year are persuaded to meet and reconcile. 
Moishe says, “I forgive you for any wrongs I feel you did me during the year, and I ask for your forgiveness.”
Khatskl  replies, “I forgive you, and I also ask your forgiveness.” 
“I forgive you, “says Moishe, “and I wish for you in the coming year all that you wish for me.” 
“Oh,” says Khatskl, “you’re starting again already?”

A LONG MEMORY

Mrs. Yoshimura, a Japanese senior citizen on her first trip to America, comes into Macy’s Department store in Manhattan. She walks up to Mrs. Cohen, a Jewish saleslady about her own age and says, “Excuse me, can you tell me where the cosmetics department is?”
“Oh,” says Mrs. Cohen, “Pearl Harbor you could find?”

OUT TO SEA

A grandmother and granddaughter are at the beach.  Suddenly a wave comes in and sweeps the little girl out to sea. 
The grandmother looks up to Heaven and cries, “Dear God, please save my granddaughter!”
Another wave comes crashing in, delivering the child to shore unharmed.  
The grandmother looks up to Heaven and says, “She had a hat.”

THE ARTFUL MATCHMAKER

“Shadkhn” (Yiddish): matchmaker.

A shadkhn comes to a prospective groom, and announces “Have I got a match for you! She’s as beautiful as a work of art!”
The young man agrees to meet the prospect. When the shadkhn returns a few days later, the young man is furious: “A work of art? Some work of art! One eye half closed, the other too large. One ear a good inch below the other, and the nose off center by at least a half inch!”
“So,” asks the shadkhn, “Picasso you don’t like?”

THE INSIDE STRAIGHT

Six retired guys are playing poker in their Miami Beach condo rec room. Goldstein loses five hundred dollars trying to fill an inside straight. He clutches his chest, staggers, and falls to the floor—dead.
The question is, how are they going to tell Mrs. Goldstein? Mandelbaum says, “Don’t worry; I can do it diplomatically.”
So up he goes to the Goldstein apartment and knocks. Mrs. Goldstein comes to the door.
“I’ve got some bad news,” says Mandelbaum, “Your husband just lost five hundred dollars in poker, and is afraid of how you might react.”
“Tell him he should only drop dead!” she replies.
“OK,” says Mandelbaum, “I’ll tell him.”

THE COLLEGE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT

Here is a tale that can serve as revenge for all those who experienced anti-Jewish quotas in college:
A college president tells his Dean of Admissions that they are getting too many Jews at the school, and they need to start “changing the balance.” The president says, “Use the interviews with prospective freshmen to weed out the Jews. Don’t ask overt questions: that’s illegal. Find some clever ways to get the information.”
So the Dean does this. He eliminates all the obvious ones: Cohen, Levy, Goldstein, and other Jewish or Jewish-sounding names. For the rest, he questions where they live, whether they’re interested in religion, if they’ve ever been to Israel….
One day he gets a candidate with a neutral name: Green. From a mixed neighborhood. Never been abroad. So he questions the kid about his interests, whether he is religious, but comes up empty on all counts.
Finally in desperation he asks, “Mr. Green, do you happen to speak Yiddish?”
Green replies, “Enough to get around in this campus.”

ISRAEL’S WEATHER

Moyshe returns from his first trip to Israel. His friends ask, “So how was it?”
“Nice, but hot! 110 degrees in the shade.”
“So who told you to stand in the shade?”

THE BET

Levine and Feinberg are sitting on their usual Miami park bench, making their usual bets.
“I’ll bet you two dollars that the next plane to fly overhead is a 747.”
“I’ll bet you three dollars that the next girl to walk by is a natural blonde.”
Finally Levine says to Feinberg, “How about a real bet? I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that soft is by me longer than is hard by you.”
“Soft is by you longer than is hard by me?” says Feinberg, “You got a bet! So how long is soft by you?”
“Since 1956.”

PRIESTLY GARB

Moishe Feigenbaum, newly arrived from Czarist Russia, is riding the New York subway for the first time. He sees across from him a Catholic priest. Not recognizing the clerical garb (Russian Orthodox priests wear long cassocks), Moishe approaches him and says, “Mister, you got your shoyt on beckvards.”
“I’m a Father,” replies the priest.
“Fadder shmadder,” says Moishe, “You still got your shoyt on beckvards.”
“You don’t understand,” says the priest, “I am a Father to thousands.”
“Mister,” says Moishe, “Never mind de shoyt. Better you should put your pents on beckvards!”

THE MORE THINGS CHANGE…

Vladimir goes for a job at a large Moscow firm. The head of personnel asks if there is anything in Vladimir’s past that they should know.
“Yes,” says Vladimir, “My grandfather was a general in the army of the last Czar.”
“Please comrade,” replies the personnel chief, “we are not barbarians. That was more than half a century ago. We do not hold grudges. Anything else?”
“In fact, yes,” says Vladimir, “My great-grandmother was a Jew.”
“Comrade,” replies the head of personnel, “this is the Soviet Union. We are not prejudiced against any religion. But come to think of it, your grandfather’s service in the Czar’s army may present a problem….”

A BAD BET

A priest, a minister and a rabbi all served congregations in a town near the Canadian border. They were good friends, and even more—drinking buddies. One day, several sheets to the wind, they decided to make a bet: who can convert a bear? So off they all stagger into the North Woods.
Three days later, the priest and minister are visiting the rabbi in the hospital. Swathed in bandages, the rabbi asks, “How did it go?”
“Well,” said the priest, “I went into the woods with a vial of holy water, and suddenly a bear rushed at me. Just as he was about to grab me, I threw the holy water at him and cried, ‘I hereby baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.’ The bear dropped to its knees and clasped its hands together. I left.”
Said the minister, “I went into the woods and stayed near the river. A bear came rushing at me, so I ran down to the river and jumped in. He followed me. As soon as he was in the water, I shouted, ‘You are now baptized and are born again!’ The bear became as gentle as a lamb, and began to emit soft growls as if he were praying. I left.”
“But what happened to you?” they asked.
“You ever try to circumcise a bear?”

KOSHER DANISH

Nazi Germany’s occupation of Denmark began on April 9, 1940, and lasted until German forces withdrew at the end of World War II following their surrender to the Allies on May 5, 1945. Surprisingly, there are Danish Jewish jokes about the occupation. Here is one.

Cohen is picked up by the Gestapo in occupied Copenhagen and brought to their headquarters for questioning. As he sits in the commandant’s office trembling with fear, the phone rings. The commandant picks it up, listens for a minute disgustedly, hands the phone to Cohen and tells him, “I don’t speak Danish. You translate.” Cohen takes the receiver and says, “Gestapo. Cohen speaking.”

THE FLASHER

Tailoring was a popular Jewish trade, especially among immigrants to America. Those who had to learn the skill here were actually called “Columbuses shnayders”: Columbus’s tailors.
Pauline, a retired seamstress, is walking down Fifth Avenue, when suddenly a man in a raincoat opens it wide, and exposes himself. She peers closely, and remarks, “That you call a lining?”

MERRY CHRISTMAS

A Jew goes to a minister and asks to be converted.
“Before I do so,” says the minister, “I need to know if you are familiar with the basic facts of our faith. Where was Jesus born?”
The Jew thinks for a minute, and answers, “Pittsburgh.”
“You can’t be serious!” exclaims the minister.
“Maybe it was Philadelphia,” hazards the potential convert.
The minister shakes his head. “Sorry, but you have so little knowledge that I simply cannot support your conversion.”
“OK,” says the Jew, “So where was Jesus born?”
“Bethlehem,” replies the minister.
“Well,” comes the rejoinder, “at least I knew it was Pennsylvania.”

HAPPY EASTER

A Jew decides to convert to Christianity. He goes to a priest who says, “I’ll be glad to convert you, providing you can satisfy me that you know the basics of our faith.”
“Ask away,” says the Jew.
“What is the meaning of Easter?”
The Jew quickly replies, “Jesus was crucified on Good Friday, and buried in a cave. On Easter Sunday, he arose from his tomb and went out among the multitudes.”
“Excellent,” says the priest, “And then what did he do?”
“He looked around, he saw his shadow, he went back into the cave, and they had six more weeks of winter.”

THE OIL OF LOVE

An Italian, a Frenchman, and a Jew are boasting about their love lives. The Italian says, “I rub my wife’s entire body with the finest olive oil before we make love; she screams for fifteen minutes.”
The Frenchman says, ” “I rub my wife’s entire body with the finest French butter before we make love; she screams for thirty minutes.”
The Jew says, “I rub my wife’s entire body with the finest chicken shmaltz before we make love; she screams for two hours.”
“Wow! Two hours? Really?”
“Yes. I wipe my hands on the drapes.”

GOING NATIVE

(Sit shivah: Carry out the seven days of mourning)
Howie Solomon calls his mother from North Dakota State University. “Mama, I have wonderful news! I got married!”
“Oh? To whom, may I ask?” says Mama.
“She’s a Native American,” replies Howie, “And you’ll meet her and her family tomorrow. We’re flying to New York.”
The next day, Mrs. Solomon’s bell rings, and she opens the door to see Howie, together with his bride and two men, all in their native garb.
“Mama, I’d like you to meet my wife, Running Deer, my father-in-law, Stalking Bear, and my brother-in-law, Soaring Eagle.”
“Very pleased to make your acquaintance,” says Mrs. Solomon, “I’m Howard’s mother, Sitting Shiva.

 MORE INFORMATION THAN NEEDED
 
 A Hassid in full battle dress: shtrayml (fur hat) , kapote (long coat) , beard and peyes (earlocks) enters a supermarket, goes up to the appetizing counter, points at the baked Virginia ham, and says to the clerk, “I’d like a pound of that nice kosher turkey.”
“But sir,” replies the clerk, “that’s not turkey, it’s ham.”
The Hassid fixes her with a cold stare. “Did I ask you?”

ONE LAST WISH

A rabbi, a cantor, and a shammes (beadle) are captured by terrorists between Rosh Hashoneh and Yom Kippur. The terrorists offer each a last wish before being killed.
The rabbi says, “I have written a a new sermon for Yom Kippur. I would like to preach it to you.” The terrorists agree.
The cantor says, “I have written a new liturgy for Kol Nidrei. I would like to chant it to you.” Agreed.
The shammes says, “Kill me first.”

KOSHERER THAN THOU

Moses goes up to the mountain to talk to God, and God is giving
him the commandments and other rules to write down. At one
point God says, “Remember Moses, it’s cruel to cook a calf
in its mother’s milk.”
Moses: Oh, so we should never eat milk and meat together?
God: No, it’s just cruel to cook an a calf in its mother’s milk.
Moses: Ah, so we should have separate dishes for milk and meat then?
God: No, it’s just cruel to cook a calf in its mother’s milk.
Moses: And when eventually we have dishwashers we should have one for each set of plates?
God: Moses, do what you want.

THE UNKINDEST CUT

A fellow is visiting a strange town, when he notices that his watch has stopped. He walks down the main street and comes upon a storefront filled with watches: in display cases, in the windows, on the walls. He walks in and asks the proprietor to repair his watch.
“I don’t fix watches. I’m a moyhel (circumciser),” is the reply.
“Then why do you have watches displayed everywhere?” asks the frustrated customer.
The proprietor replies, “So what would you like me to display?”


 






AMERICAN JEWISH HUMOR
American Jewish humor is generally quite different from its predecessors. To be sure, the Jews encountered anti-Semitism here, and they reacted to it with jokes. But the preponderance of this humor is more about assimilation, acculturation, encounter, dialogue, and friendly competition than persecution. As Jews immigrated at the end of the nineteenth century to the United States (and other countries willing to extend them full civil rights), a new set of conditions arose to try them. Instead of constant oppression, they now had to deal with just how much they would assimilate into the surrounding culture, what they would gain, and what they might lose. These questions continue engaging us today. Like all such existential problems, they are a source of humor.

IMMIGRANTS
Berl, Merl, and Shmerl decide to immigrate to America from Poland. They land at Ellis Island, where they are advised to change their names to something more American.
Berl has been reading Yiddish translations of Westerns and promptly changes his name to Buck.
Merl, not to be outdone, changes his to Muck.
Shmerl goes back to Poland.

PATRIOTS
Just as Jews in the Old Country were proud of their respective towns, so are American Jews partisans of the cities in which they live. New York Jews carry it to extremes. Mrs. Goldberg and Mrs. Fein take their first trip to the West Coast. They get off the plane in Los Angeles in the middle of a heat wave.
“Boy, is it hot here!” says Mrs. Goldberg.
“What do you expect?” says Mrs. Fein. “We’re 3,000 miles from the ocean.”

EDUCATION	
Here is a tale that can serve as revenge for all of us who experienced anti-Jewish quotas in college:
A college president tells his dean of admissions they are getting too many Jews at the school and they need to start changing the balance. 
The president says, “Use the interviews with prospective freshmen to weed out the Jews. Don’t ask overt questions. That’s illegal. Find some clever ways to get the information.”
So the dean does this. He eliminates all the obvious ones: Cohen, Levy, Goldstein, and other Jewish or Jewish-sounding names. For the rest, he questions where they live, whether they’re interested in religion, if they’ve ever been to Israel…
One day, he gets a candidate with the neutral name of Green. He is from a mixed neighborhood and has never been abroad. He questions the kid about his interests and if he is religious, but he comes up empty on all counts.
Finally, in desperation, he asks, “Mr. Green, do you happen to speak Yiddish?”
Green replies, “Enough to get around in this campus.”
SPORTS
Sports is another topic that is characteristically American Jewish.
Yeshiva University decided to field a rowing crew. Unfortunately, they lose contest after contest. They just can’t figure out what’s wrong. They decide to send out a spy to see how the other colleges do it.
So, they send Yankel to spy on the Harvard crew. Yankel heads off to Cambridge to keep a close watch on the Charles River. Some time later, he returns, bursting with enthusiasm.
“I have it. I know the secret of winning. They have eight guys rowing and only one guy shouting.”

JEWS AND GENTILES
Typical of American Jewish humor is “friendly dialogue” between Jews and Gentiles. In these jokes, the cultures don’t actually clash. They just kind of bump up against each other.
Two friends, Sol and Frank, of Jewish and Italian origin, respectively, are trying to decide where to vacation.
“How about the Poconos?” proposes Frank. “A lot of my people go there.”
“Nah,” says Sol, “let’s go to the Catskills. A great place to meet the ladies.”
Frank is hesitant. “Sure, I’d like to meet some nice ladies, but they’re Jewish. What happens if they ask me about myself?”
Sol has his advice ready. “You tell them your name is Frank. You’re from the Bronx. You’re a manufacturer. If they ask what you manufacture, you tell them talleysim. Can you remember that? Talleysim.”
“What’s it mean?” asks Frank.
“Never mind,” Sol reassures him. “Once you say talleysim, they won’t even question your origins.”
And so it goes. The first night in the Catskills, Sol and Frank are at the resort bar. A very attractive woman strikes up a conversation with Frank.
“What’s your name?”
“Frank.”
“Where are you from?”
“The Bronx.”
“What do you do?”
“I’m a manufacturer.”
“What do you manufacture?”
“Talleysim,” says Frank without hesitation. 
The woman thinks for a few seconds and says, “You know, I’ve always wondered what those Hebrew words around the collar say.”
Frank replies, “I wouldn’t know. We just make the sleeves.”

LANGUAGE CONTACT JOKES

Yiddish and German
Related languages often have what the French call faux amis (false friends), that is, the same word has acquired different meanings. One such is schmecken, which, in German, means “to taste, to have flavor.” In most Yiddish dialects, it means “to smell, to have an odor.”
A Jew orders a bowl of soup in a German restaurant. The waiter brings it. The Jew begins eating, and the solicitous waiter asks, “Das schmeckt?” [Does it taste good?] 
“Nein, das schmeckt nicht,” [No, it doesn’t smell,]  replies the Jew. 
The waiter summarily removes the uneaten soup and returns with another bowl.
The same scene is played out again…and yet again. By the fourth bowl, the Jew hunches protectively over the bowl. 
	When the waiter asks, “Das schmeckt?” the Jew replies angrily, “Ja, das schmeckt! Das schtinkt! Nun lass mich essen!” [Yes, it smells! It stinks! Now let me eat!]

Yiddish and Hebrew
The founders of modern Israel, most of them native Yiddish speakers, made Herculean efforts to master modern Hebrew as part of the ideology of transforming the Diaspora Jew. But sometimes the effort proved too much.
On a broiling summer day in the 1950s, a busload of American Jewish tourists pulls up to Sde Boker, Ben Gurion’s kibbutz, where they come upon the prime minister himself, discussing politics with President Yitskhak Ben Zvi in Yiddish.
One tourist, ardent Zionist she, approaches and asks in Hebrew, “Lama atem lo midabrim ivrit?” [Why aren’t you speaking Hebrew?]
Ben Gurion turns to Ben Zvi and mutters, in Yiddish, “Fertzig grad, un zi vil az mir zoln redn hebreyish?” [40°C (104°F), and she wants us to speak Hebrew?]

Yiddish and English
The encounter with English is of a rather different order. This tongue, representing a new life in a new country, is notoriously difficult with more exceptions than rules as well as the usual range of idiomatic expressions completely opaque to the novice. The immigrants eventually mastered their new language…not, however, without some amusing results.
“My wife’s having an affair.”
“Oh? Who’s the caterer?”

“You’ve been sleeping with my wife!”
“I swear, not a wink!”

“A fly was sitting on my nose half the night.”
“Why didn’t you just brush it off?”
“I didn’t realize it was dusty.”
“That tiger belongs to the feline family.”
“And they just went away and left it in a cage?”

An elderly Jewish lady is accosted on the street by a shabbily dressed man who says, “I haven’t eaten anything in three days!”
“Force yourself.”

An elderly Jewish man is run over. He’s lying in the street when the paramedics arrive. As they load him carefully onto the stretcher, one asks, “Are you comfortable?”
He replies, “Thank God, I make a living.”


ZIONISM AND ISRAEL
The reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty after almost two millennia unsurprisingly gives rise to a new brand of humor. Many new brands in fact, including humor of the Zionist pioneers, Ashkenazic and Sephardic Israelis, as well as Israeli Arab and Palestinian Arab humor. Here are a few of my favorites:

There are many stories about the lack of arms and equipment that plagued the Jews during Israel’s War of Independence. One such tells of a new immigrant who volunteers for the just-born Israeli Navy. He signs up and requests a uniform.
“Sorry, we don’t have uniforms,” the recruiting officer tells him.
“How about a rifle or pistol?” asks the new recruit.
“Sorry, we don’t have any.”
As the recruit leaves the office, the enlistment officer stops him.
“I forgot to ask. Can you swim?”
“What!” exclaims the new recruit. “No boats either?”

The early twentieth-century Yiddish writer Sholem Asch, who wrote controversial novels about Jesus and Mary, had a reputation as a cheapskate. Legend has it that, in the1920s, Asch was visiting the Sea of Galilee, near the locale of the Sermon on the Mount, and wanted to take a boat across to the newly founded Kibbutz Ein Gev. When the oarsman quoted him the price of the ride, Asch reputedly said, “No wonder Jesus walked!”

A newly arrived Russian immigrant opens a bank account and withdraws his first fifty shekels. Eager to show off his command of Hebrew, he counts out the money in a loud voice, “Ekhad, shtayim, shalosh…” 
Completing the count, he starts again.
The bank clerk, pretty irritated by now, asks, “What’s the matter? Didn’t I give you the right amount?”
“Yes,” sniffs the immigrant, “but just barely.”

Finally, a story demonstrating the Jewish adage, “We are all one.” 

Two American Jews decide to sample Tel Aviv nightlife. They go to a café, where an Israeli comic is entertaining an appreciative crowd in Hebrew, which neither of the Americans can speak. One of the Americans laughs uproariously with the audience.
“What are you laughing at?” asks his colleague. “You don’t understand Hebrew.”
“So what?” is the reply. “I trust these people!”
