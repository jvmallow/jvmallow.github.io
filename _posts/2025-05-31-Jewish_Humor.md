Many years ago, in what was an otherwise relatively humorless existence as a doctoral student in physics, I began collecting Jewish jokes. It started simply. I heard a joke, retold it, and exchanged jokes with friends. I then began collecting books of Jewish humor—first in Yiddish and then in other languages as well. As my collection grew, a kind of growth principle took over, like a runaway nuclear chain reaction. For every joke I told, I acquired at least two new ones in exchange. In short order, the thing was completely out of hand. I took to carrying blank scraps of paper to Jewish events in case I heard new jokes. In extreme cases, I wrote them down on the napkins. (Jewish events always include food, and physicists are adept at napkin-writing.) I began doing stand-up comedy. Sometimes, it was in the guise of a lecture on Jewish humor; other times, it was club dates with Chicago’s Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. Finally, I wrote a book,    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/our-pal-god-and-other-presumptions-a-book-of-jewish-humor_jeffry-v-mallow/1348356/#edition=14417790&idiq=19747705">

Here are some of the jokes therein and newer ones thereout.

Probably the oldest Jewish joke:

~~~
After smashing the first set of tablets, Moses returns
with the second set.
“I have good news and bad news,” he announces
to the assembled Israelites. 
“The good news is, I got Him down to ten.
The bad news is, adultery stays in.”

Probably the newest Jewish joke:

~~~
A priest, a minister, and a rabbit walk into a bar.  
The bartender asks the rabbit, "What are you doing here?" 
The rabbit answers, "I came in on Autocorrect."
~~~

Here are a few more.

In honor of his twenty-fifth year of service, a rabbi receives
an all-expenses paid trip to Miami from his congregation.
When he checks into his luxury hotel suite,
he discovers a beautiful woman, naked on the bed.
“What are you doing here?” he asks.
“I’m part of the congregation’s gift to you. They wanted it to be a
surprise.” The rabbi stalks over to the phone, places a call to
the president of the synagogue, and proceeds to berate him.
“How could you do such a thing? I’m shocked and appalled!”
And he slams down the phone.
He turns around to see the woman getting dressed. 
“Where are you going?” says the rabbi. “ I’m not mad at you. ”

A fellow is visiting a strange town when he notices
his watch has stopped. He walks down the main street
and comes upon a storefront filled with watches:
in display cases, in the windows, and on the walls.
He walks in and asks the proprietor to repair his watch.
“I don’t fix watches. I’m a moyhel (circumciser),”
is the reply.
“Then why do you have watches displayed everywhere?”
asks the frustrated customer.
“So what would you like me to display?”

The early twentieth-century Yiddish writer Sholem Asch,
who wrote controversial novels about Jesus and Mary,
had a reputation as a cheapskate. Legend has it
that in the 1920s, Asch was visiting the
Sea of Galilee, near the locale of the
Sermon on the Mount, and wanted to take a boat
across to the other side. When the oarsman
quoted him the price of the ride,
Asch reputedly said, “No wonder Jesus walked.”

A Jew is walking down the streets of Moscow when the czar’s
carriage drives by.The czar, in a Jew-baiting mood,
orders his driver to stop. He tells the Jew,
“Get down in the gutter behind my horses, and
eat what you find there.”
The poor Jew complies. When he’s finally allowed to rise,
he is so humiliated that he takes the chance of his life.
He overpowers the driver, wrests his pistol from him,
points it at the czar, and says, “Now you get down
behind your horses and eat what’s there.” The czar complies.
After he finishes, the Jew, holding them at bay,
disappears into an alley and runs off home.
When he arrives, his wife asks,
“Anything interesting happen today?”
“You’ll never guess who I had lunch with.”

A Catholic church adjoins a synagogue.
Each congregation wants to show how well it treats its clergyman.
The Catholics take up a collection and buy their priest a Mercedes.

The rabbi goes out to his Jaguar and saws two inches off the tailpipe.

on her first trip to America, comes
into Macy’s department store in Manhattan.

“Oh,” says Mrs. Cohen, “Pearl Harbor you could find?”

“This is the famous Vanderbilt Mansion,” says the guide.
“Cornelius Vanderbilt?” asks Morrie.
“No,” replies the guide, “William Vanderbilt.”
They go further and stop at another beautiful building.
“And this is the Astor Mansion,” says the guide.
“John Jacob Astor?” asks Morrie.
“No, Vincent Astor,” says the guide.
Finally, the bus stops in front of a beautiful church.
“And this is the famous Christ Church,” says the guide.
Mollie grabs Morrie’s arm and mutters, “Don't you open your mouth."

The Satmar Rebbe, leader of one of the most fanatically pious sects 
in all of Judaism, dies and goes to Heaven. At the Pearly Gates, he
is greeted by a host of angels. The Angel Gabriel steps forward.
“Rebbe, it is rare indeed that we have such an august personage
as yourself join us.
In your honor, there will be a reception and banquet!”
“A reception and banquet,” muses the Rebbe. “May I ask,
who is the mashgiekh? Who makes sure the food is kosher?”
Gabriel stares at him. “Rebbe, this is Heaven.
The Reboyne-sheloylem, God Himself is the mashgiekh.”
The Rebbe says, “I’ll have the fruit plate.”

It is required that Jews who have been quarreling 
with each other make peace before Yom Kippur.  
Asking and receiving forgiveness from one’s fellow 
must precede asking forgiveness from God.  
Two Jews who have been at each others’ throats for 
the entire year are persuaded to meet and reconcile. 
Moishe says, “I forgive you for any wrongs I feel 
you did me during the year, and I ask for 
your forgiveness.”
Khatskl  replies, “I forgive you, and I also ask for
your forgiveness.” 
“I forgive you, “says Moishe, “and I wish for you 
in the coming year all that you wish for me.” 
“Oh,” says Khatskl, “you’re starting already?”

A Jew passes a store and sees a sign: 
"Davening Parrot". He goes in and asks to hear the bird daven.
The proprietor says to the parrot, 'Daven the Rosh Hashonah service."
With that, the parrot reaches under one wing,
whips out a yarmulke,reaches under the other wing,
whips out a siddur, and begins
to daven the service.  Flawlessly.
The Jew says, "I'll buy him."
One month later is Rosh Hashonah.
The Jew brings the parrot
to shul and starts laying bets.
"Ten to one this parrot can daven the service."
When all the bets are down, he tells the parrot, "Daven."
No response. The parrot sits there, silent.
The owner is humiliated and in serious debt.
He stalks out of the synagogue with the parrot.
After they're out of earshot, he demands,
"Why didn't you daven? You just cost me
a pile of dough!"
"Relax," says the parrot. "We're gonna
clean up on Yom Kippur."

A Jewish mountain climber is caught in a sudden avalanche.
As he is swept down the mountain by the rushing snow, he
manages to grab a branch. Hanging on for dear life, he casts
his eyes heavenward, and cries “Lord, Lord, please save me!”
The sky opens, a beam of blinding light appears, and from Heaven
is heard a voice: “Trust in me. Let go of the branch.”
The Jew again casts his eyes heavenward and asks,
“Is there someone else up there I could talk to?”

Goldstein brags that he knows everyone. Finally his friend
Shulweiss decides to call his bluff. “Do you know the Pope?”
“What a question! Of course I know the Pope; we’re good
buddies,”says Goldstein.
“OK,” says Shulweiss, “Here’s two tickets to Rome. You and I
are going, and I want to see you with the Pope.” So off they go.
Twenty four hours later, they’re in the square outside St. Peter’s.
The Pope is scheduled to bless the crowd in fifteen minutes.
“So, big shot?” says Shulweiss.
“So watch,” says Goldstein, and disappears into the crowd.
Fifteen minutes later, a roar goes up, and Shulweiss
sees the Pope appear on the balcony –with Goldstein at his side!
Shulweiss isdumbfounded. As he stands there with his mouth open,
a little Italian fellow taps him on the shoulder, and says,
“Hey, who’s the guy up there with Goldstein?”

A priest and a rabbi have been friends for many years.
One day the priest asks the rabbi, “Tell me the truth, have
you ever had ham?”
“Well,” replies the rabbi, “since you’re such a good friend,
I’ll confess to you. Before I was ordained, I tried ham once.
But let me ask you something.  Have you ever had sex?”
“Well,” replies the priest, “since we’re such good friends,
I’ll tell you: before I took holy orders, I tried sex once.”
“Better than ham, wasn’t it?”says the rabbi.
