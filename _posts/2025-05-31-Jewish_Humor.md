Many years ago, in what was an otherwise relatively humorless existence as a doctoral student in physics, I began collecting Jewish jokes. It started simply. I heard a joke, retold it, and exchanged jokes with friends. I then began collecting books of Jewish humor—first in Yiddish and then in other languages as well. As my collection grew, a kind of growth principle took over, like a runaway nuclear chain reaction. For every joke I told, I acquired at least two new ones in exchange. In short order, the thing was completely out of hand. I took to carrying blank scraps of paper to Jewish events in case I heard new jokes. In extreme cases, I wrote them down on the napkins. (Jewish events always include food, and physicists are adept at napkin-writing.) I began doing stand-up comedy. Sometimes, it was in the guise of a lecture on Jewish humor; other times, it was club dates with Chicago’s Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. 

Many books are written about the meaning and purpose(s) of humor. Some have focused on Jewish humor. I have written one: 
Our Pal God and Other Presumptions

Here are some of the jokes therein and newer ones thereout. I'll upload more each week. Watch this space!

TECH SUPPORT

A priest, a minister, and a rabbit walk into  bar.  The bartender asks the rabbit, "What are you doing here?" The rabbit answer, "I came in on autocorrect.""

THIS YOU CALL ENGLISH? A TRIAD

-An elderly Jewish man is run over. He’s lying in the street when the paramedics arrive. As they load him carefully onto the stretcher, one asks, “Are you comfortable?”
He replies, “Thank God, I make a living.”

-An elderly Jewish lady is run over. A lawyer rushes to her side, hands her his card, and says, “Call me: I can get you damages.”
The lady replies, “Damages I already have. What I need is repairs!”

-“Sadie,” asks Minnie, “tell me, do you and Sam have mutual orgasm.”
Sadie thinks for a minute and says, “No, I think we have State Farm.”

OUT TO SEA

A grandmother and granddaughter are at the beach.  Suddenly a wave comes in and sweeps the little girl out to sea. 
The grandmother looks up to Heaven and cries, “Dear God, please save my granddaughter!”
Another wave comes crashing in, delivering the child to shore unharmed.  
The grandmother looks up to Heaven and says, “She had a hat.”
