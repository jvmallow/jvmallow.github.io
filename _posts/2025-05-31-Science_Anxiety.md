In 1978, as a young assistant professor at Loyola University Chicago, I became aware that some students were doing poorly, although it seemed to me that they were bright and hardworking. What was going on? The term “science anxiety” leapt into mind, and I coined it forthwith. I hearkened back to my own days as an undergraduate physics major. I experienced crippling panic on exams, and did so poorly that my advisor told me that I was not smart enough to become a physicist. In the early 70’s, the concept of math anxiety had been recognized and various measures were being taken to alleviate it, including “clinics”: small groups of math- anxious students working with mathematicians and psychologists. I proposed to the Loyola Counseling Center that we try a Science Anxiety Clinic. We did, and it worked. 

In 1991, I was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to Denmark, where I investigated science anxiety among college students. I continued these studeis, and in 1996, I had the good fortune of meeting a Danish mathematician and physicist who expressd the desire to work with me. His name is Helge Kastrup, and everything I say further on this page is due to our partnership. Ov the last few decades, we and our co-researchers studied sciences anxiety in high school and college students. Helge and I published two books on the theme, the first on general science anxiety: 
-Student Attitudes, Student Anxieties, and How to Address Them: A Handbook for Science Teachers, H. Kastrup and J. V. Mallow, London: Institute of Physics (2016)
and the second on physics in particular:
-Fear of Physics, H. Kastrup and J. V. Mallow, London: Institute of Physics (2023).
Here is a quote.
"The psychology of anxiety was considered as early as 1844 by the Danish philosopher Søren Kirkegaard in his book Begrebet Angest (The Concept of Anxiety). He distinguished between fear (frygt) and anxiety (angest). Fear deals with things of which there is good reason to be afraid, such as a viper in your bed. Anxiety on the other hand means being scared of something that is not intrinsically fearful. Science anxiety is not a viper in your bed. But to a science-anxious person, it feels like it. Many students suffer from science anxiety, affecting their studies, excluding them from careers where science and math are prerequisites, and leaving them uninformed citizens whose political decisions are not based on good information or careful analysis. The causes of science anxiety are many, including past bad experiences in science classes, science-anxious teachers in elementary and secondary schools, a lack of role models, gender and racial stereotyping, and the stereotyping of scientists in the popular media.
So is science anxiety an inborn deficiency that the pupil has to accept as narrowing his or her potential course of study? No. There are ways to diminish rather than create or enhance anxiety."
