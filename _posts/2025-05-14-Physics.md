### What is physics?
According to the Oxford Languages Dictionary https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/, physics is “the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics, distinguished from that of chemistry and biology, includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.” 





### What do physicists do?

-They teach in secondary schools, universities, and other venues such as teachers' colleges.

-They do research, both "pure" and applied. (I'm not cazy about the adjective "pure"; it makes it sound like applied physics is impure.  But we're stuck with it.)

According to AI, 
"Pure and applied physics" refers to two complementary approaches to the study of physics. Pure physics focuses on understanding the fundamental laws of nature, while applied physics focuses on using those laws to develop practical technologies and solve real-world problems."  (In this case, AI is correct.)



My career consisted of both teaching and research, as well as naming, studying, and reducing science anxiety. See section Science Anxiety.

# TEACHING

Physics avoidance” is common for example, in US high schools, sometimes aided and abetted by making it non-required. Of US university students, only one third of one percent are studying physics as their major subject. Even among the STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students, only two percent are majoring in physics. In comic--and sometimes not-so-comic--stereotypes, mad physicists play a prominent role. Examples:

  - The Invisible Ray: “A scientist becomes murderous after discovering, and being exposed to the radiation of, a powerful new element called Radium X.”

  - Man Made Monster: “A mad scientist turns a man into an electrically-controlled monster to do his bidding.”
  
  - The Fly: “A scientist has a horrific accident when he tries to use his newly invented teleportation device.”
  
  - Monster of Terror: “A young man visits his fiancée's estate to discover that her wheelchair-bound scientist father has discovered a meteorite that emits mutating radiation rays that have turned the plants in his greenhouse to giants.” 

  - Last, but surely not least, Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. (“Mein Führer, I can valk!”) Even the good guys, such as Spiderman and the Hulk gained their powers by exposure to radioactivity.

To be fair, Dr. Frankenstein was a biologist. And although it is not related to physics, who can resist The Devil Bat? “A mad scientist develops an aftershave lotion that causes his gigantic bats to kill anyone who wears it.”

Teaching methods:

The traditional method has been the lecture, known variously as "chalk and talk" and 'the sage on the stage". It need not be abandoned, but over the last few decades, various teaching strategies have been shown to aid science learning. These include:

•	The implementation of teacher–student and student–student interaction in lieu of straight lecturing.

•	The design of laboratories to elicit creativity in approaches to problem definition and solution, in lieu of “cookbook” instructions.

•	The demonstration of multiple approaches to acquiring scientific knowledge,  “Show that the period of a pendulum doesn't depend on its mass" versus "On what does the period of a pendulum depend?"

•	The recommendation of alternative presentations of materials from other textbooks, journals, and popular expositions.



## Courses

Check pretty much any university physics syllabi, and they will generally include 

- a course for social science and humanities students (Alternately called Liberal Arts Physics or more cutely, Physics for Poets)

- several introductory courses for physics majors and others who need it for various requirements, such as chemistry majors and pre-medical/dental aspirants

- intermediate and advanced courses for physics majors, including specialties such as Pre-engineering and Biophysics

I taught most of those. Instead of a long description, I will describe my favorite: Liberal Arts Physics, then mention a course for physics students. 

Liberal Arts Physics. 

It's one thing to teach majors' courses, where the students think like us; it's quite another to teach students who think differently. I employ various techniques. One I call the modified Socratic method. I briefly lecture on the subject at hand. Then I ask a question about the material I just chalked and talked.  I don’t ask for hands. To do so favors the quick and the glib. Instead, I choose a student (preferably one who does not usually shoot their hand up) and ask her or him the question. Then I wait.  Either the student will answer in a reasonable time, or cannot. If the latter, I follow up with a question whose answer led up to it. If the student still cannot answer, I go back further. In my experience, almost all students will reach a point, perhaps several questions back, when they can answer. Then I bring them forward. 

There are two ostensible difficulties with this method. First is the time consumed. Second is the possibility of provoking the student’s anxiety. For the first, the time used acts as a review of the subject for the other students, some of whom are unsure of the various answers. For the second, it is the teacher’s obligation to make clear that this is the case, and to assure the student—and all the others—that the procedure will be used randomly on all the students. Finally, the teacher should praise the student as each of the questions is answered. 

I use in-class group exercises in lieu of labs, which are not usually part of the liberal arts physics course. For example, when we are studying circular motion, I divide the class into two groups; one to disuss how a clothes washer works; the other, a clothes dryer. I ask them to estimate the various rotational speeds for typical washers and dryers--they pick the radii. We could do similar exercises for roller coasters and playground swings.

Freshman physics projects.

For freshman physics students we have group projects. These are semester-long, several hours a week. Students select projects and choose an instructor as adviser. Here are some examples:

High friction surfaces

Dynamics of motion in vertical circles

Seismological models in the laboratory 

Friction on ice

Analysis of pianos

Investigation of wind turbines and solar cells  

At the conclusion of the course, each group makes a presentation to faculty and any students who wish to attend. These are 12 minutes long: 10 for presentation, 2 for questions and comments. (The amounts are fexible.) Each of the group members presents part of the report. Grading by the advisors is for each individual student, and for the group as a whole. Our freshman project course is just onne of many examples of group project work. It has been shown to be pedagogically effective. One of the greatest virtues of group project work is that it levels the playing field, especially for females and less confident students.

Much more can be said about pedagogy, but this shall suffice. You can find more in Helge Kastrup's and my book, *Fear of Physics*    https://iopscience.iop.org/book/mono/978-0-7503-4866-9
