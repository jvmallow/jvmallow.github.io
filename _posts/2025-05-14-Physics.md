# What is physics?
According to the Oxford Languages Dictionary https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/, physics is “the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics, distinguished from that of chemistry and biology, includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.”

Science anxiety and how to conquer it

In 1978, as a young assistant professor at Loyola University Chicago, I became aware that some students were doing poorly, although it seemed to me that they were bright and hardworking. What was going on? The term “science anxiety” leapt into mind, and I coined it forthwith. I hearkened back to my own days as an undergraduate physics major. I experienced crippling panic on exams, and did so poorly that my advisor told me that I was not smart enough to become a physicist. In the early 70’s, the concept of math anxiety had been recognized and various measures were being taken to alleviate it, including “clinics”: small groups of math- anxious students working with mathematicians and psychologists. I proposed to the Loyola Counseling Center that we try a Science Anxiety Clinic. We did, and it worked. 

One glaring feature of math anxiety was gender disparity: women were more math anxious, and avoided studying math. Was this true about science? The answer turned out to be Yes.
