### What is physics?
According to the Oxford Languages Dictionary https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/, physics is “the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics, distinguished from that of chemistry and biology, includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.” 





### What do physicists do?

-They teach in secondary schools, universities, and other venues such as teachers' colleges.

-They do research, both "pure" and applied. (I'm not cazy about the adjective "pure"; it makes it sound like applied physics is impure.  But we're stuck with it.)

According to AI, 
"Pure and applied physics" refers to two complementary approaches to the study of physics. Pure physics focuses on understanding the fundamental laws of nature, while applied physics focuses on using those laws to develop practical technologies and solve real-world problems."  (In this case, AI is correct.)



My career consisted of both teaching and research, as well as naming, studying, and reducing science anxiety. See section Science Anxiety.

### TEACHING

Physics avoidance” is common for example, in US high schools, sometimes aided and abetted by making it non-required. Of US university students, only one third of one percent are studying physics as their major subject. Even among the STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students, only two percent are majoring in physics. In comic--and sometimes not-so-comic--stereotypes, mad physicists play a prominent role. Examples:

  - The Invisible Ray: “A scientist becomes murderous after discovering, and being exposed to the radiation of, a powerful new element called Radium X.”

  - Man Made Monster: “A mad scientist turns a man into an electrically-controlled monster to do his bidding.”
  
  - The Fly: “A scientist has a horrific accident when he tries to use his newly invented teleportation device.”
  
  - Monster of Terror: “A young man visits his fiancée's estate to discover that her wheelchair-bound scientist father has discovered a meteorite that emits mutating radiation rays that have turned the plants in his greenhouse to giants.” 

  - Last, but surely not least, Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. (“Mein Führer, I can valk!”) Even the good guys, such as Spiderman and the Hulk gained their powers by exposure to radioactivity.

To be fair, Dr. Frankenstein was a biologist. And although it is not related to physics, who can resist The Devil Bat? “A mad scientist develops an aftershave lotion that causes his gigantic bats to kill anyone who wears it.”

Teaching methods:

Lecturing: Sage on the stage; chalk and talk

Over the last few decades, various teaching strategies have been shown to aid science learning. These include:


•	The implementation of teacher–student and student–student interaction in lieu of straight lecturing.

•	The design of laboratories to elicit creativity in approaches to problem definition and solution, in lieu of “cookbook” instructions.

•	The demonstration of multiple approaches to acquiring scientific knowledge,  “Show that T is mass-indep vs. on what does T depend?

•	The recommendation of alternative presentations of materials from other textbooks, journals, and popular expositions.



## Courses

Check pretty much any university physics syllabi, and they will generally include 

- a course for social science and humanities students (Alternately called Liberal Arts Physics or more cutely, Physics for Poets)

- several introductory courses for physics majors and others who need it for various requirements, such as chemistry majors and pre-medical/dental aspirants

- intermediate and advanced courses for physics majors, including specialties such as Pre-engineering and Biophysics

I taught most of those. My favorite was Liberal Arts Physics. It's one thing to teach majors' courses, where the students think like the us; it's quite another to teach students who are very different from us. 

In Liberal Arts Physics, I used various methods:

some lecturing; inverse socratic method--no show of hands; group work; no eqns to memorize

# Physics of the atmosphere

Lidar, fog.. Backscatter; stability; size distrib."

# Physics of the atom

Bohr atom; scf; muonic atoms

# SUSY QM

Bohr-like orbits-> energy levels. Schr ODE hard; quantum leaps.  
stringed instruments tuned like SUSY.
