# What is physics?
According to the Oxford Languages Dictionary https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/, physics is “the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics, distinguished from that of chemistry and biology, includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.” 

# What do physicists do?

-They teach in secondary schools, universities and other venues such as teachers' colleges.

-They do research, both "pure" and applied. (I'm not cazy about the adjective "pure"; it makes it sound like applied physics is impure.  But we're stuck with it.)

According to AI,

"Pure and applied physics" refers to two complementary approaches to the study of physics. Pure physics focuses on understanding the fundamental laws of nature, while applied physics focuses on using those laws to develop practical technologies and solve real-world problems."  (In this case, AI is correct.)

My career consisted of both teaching and research in pure physics, as well as naming, studying, and reducing science anxiety. See section Science Anxiety for details.
